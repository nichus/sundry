Module 5 - Buckets and indexes (lots of data from DataAdmin class)
  Show data utilization for an index with details
    |dbinspect index=<index>
  Can set the search default window per app
  ui-prefs.conf
    [search]
    dispatch.earliest_time = -24h@h
    dispatch.latest_time = now

Module 6 - Splunk Index Management
  Recommend
    rolling hot buckets daily,
    maxHotBuckets - limit of 10 hot buckets for a high volume index (default 3)
    frozenTimePeriodInSecs - how long to wait before freezing buckets
    index.conf 
      [volume:fast]
      path = <>
      maxVolumeDataSizeMB = <size>

      [soc]
      homePath = volume:fast/soc/db   # homePath is hot and warm buckets
      homePath.maxDataSizeMB = <size>
      coldPath                        # Same thing for cold

    Backups
      $SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk // indexes
      $SPLUNK_HOME/etc            // configs

      Hot buckets cannot be backed up without stopping splunk, or using snapshots
        Alternatively, forhigh volume, multiple daily incremental backups to grab data frequently
    Moving an index
      stop splunk
      then move the directories
      then update indexes.conf to point at the new locations
      if a global move, update SPLUNK_DB environment variable
    Removing data
      wait for expiration
      delete command marks as deleted, doesn't free space need to the the special can_delete role for that
        Search> search for some records | delete
        > splunk clean [eventdata|userdata|all] [-index name]
          Actually removes the data from the index entirely, frees space
          if no index is provided, deletes all the data!
  Restoring Data from frozen
    only raw data is frozen, no indexes
    copy archive directory into the index specific thaweddb directory
    The rebuild the index for that data, doesn't recharge for licensing
      > splunk rebuild <path to thawed bucket directory>

  Index replication
    
Module 8: Authentication Integration
  LDAP, PAM, RADIUS, AD, etc
