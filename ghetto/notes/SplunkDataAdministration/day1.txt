Teacher: joanna@splunk.com

My Intro:
  I'm Orien (sounds like the constellation Orion), just started as a Splunk
  Engineer at Defense Point Security. I've finished a couple Splunk classes
  over the last month, nothing practical yet, Linux for 20+ years. Dogs.

Goals:
  Manage and deploy forwarders with management (Module 4&5, critically important)
  configure common splunk data inputs
  customize input parsing process
  - Not covering creating splunk indexes

Schedule 1-4 today, 4-7 tomorrow, 8-12 Friday

Module 1: Introduction
  Input > Parsing > Indexing > Searching
  Primary Components: Forwarder, Indexer, Search Head
  Additional: Heavy Forwarder, Deployment Server
  
  Splunk Data Administrator Role
    data onboarding and management
    work with users requesting new data, define events and fields for ingest
    prioritize requests
    document everything
    design and manage inputs for UF/HF to capture data
    manage parsing, line breaking, timestamp extraction
    move from testing to production
Lab 1:
  Path: /opt/splunk

Module 2: Getting Data in - Staging
  Input phase - broad strokes only
    most configuration in input.conf
    some configuration occurs in props.conf 
  Parsing phase - fine tuned tweaks
    most configuration in props.conf
    also uses transforms.conf
  _thefishbucket contains file monitoring audit information
  custom indexes control access, improve performance and control retention time for each index individually.
  Index-Time precedence, local/default file processing under apps occurs in ascii sort order
  splunk btool <conf-name> list <options>
    options: --debug --user=<user> --app=<app>
    examples: splunk bool inputs list monitor:///var/log/secure.log --debug
      --debug shows the config files that created the settings.

Module 3: getting Data in - Productin
  Universal Forwarder bandwidth limited to 256KBps by default
  UF only forward to splunk instances, and only 1 at a time
  HF can forward to other products, and more than 1 at a time
  HF can be used as a mid stage forwarder for multi-tier forwarding setups.
  HF no longer best practice

Module 4: Deployment Server
  Server classes have one or more apps
  A server has one or more classes
  so a server gets apps via the classes it belongs to
