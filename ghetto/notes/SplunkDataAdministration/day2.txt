Module 5 - Monitor Inputs
  Question: How does splunk handle file rotations if it happens during a restart? Data lost?
  Answer: Directory Monitors do, File Monitors don't
  slide 112
  splunk cmd btprobe -d SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/fishbucket/splunk_private_db --file <source> --reset

  tcp/udp default source name: <host>:<port>

  scripted input:
    * $splunk_home/etc/apps/<app_name>/bin # This is the best place for it.
    * $splunk_home/bin/scripts
    * $splunk_home/etc/system/bin
  test script: ./splunk cmd <path>/script.sh # doesn't run script, just tests that splunk can access it.
  scripted inputs can also buffer data, similar to the network collectors
  Better to have cron run the script, and dump the data to a logfile.  Make splunk monitor the logfile instead

  Module 7: windows & Agentless
    Windows
      input types: admon perfmon WinEventLog WinHostMon WinPrintMon WinRegMon
      Warning from fellow student:
          Just throwing this out there. If you monitor the registry in a way that
          causes the Universal Forwarders to send you their entire registry you
          are likely to clog WAN links. I saw a 16 Gbps WAN link go down because
          of this went thousands of Windows systems were sending over their
          registry.

      [WinEventLog://Security]
        whitelist1= "Stuff"
        whitelist2= "Other stuff"
        blacklist
      Maximum of 10 whitelists and blacklists per universal forwarder stanza
      Can do WMI remote inputs, not recommended for environments bigger than small, scales poorly, requires an AD account
      Special field extractions
        IIS: frequently reconfigured on the fly by admins.  OBvs this is a problem.
        Use indexed field extraction on the windows forwarder to correct this.
        Ensure that the header is in the same place and never moves.  Then the forwarder can use that header to pre-parse the data.
        Powershell input, otherwise teh same as the scripted input, still better to have windows schedule it instead
    Agentless
      Splunk App for Stream
        essentially a packet capture agent
        monitors the network and collects it's data there, then sends it into splunk
      HTTP Event Collector
        Splunk listens for http inputs, clients send their data to the http listener.
    Distributed HEC (HTTP Event Collector) Deployment Options
      Can scale because every splunk system can act as a collector to receive data from a load balancer
      Disabled by default Settings > Data Inputs > HTTP Inputs
      Create a token, then define metadata for the stream
      Data can be transmitted as JSON
      Can send acks, but requires additional handshaking for the response channel
      Multi-event JSON posts are possible, but in non-standard format: { stuff }{ stuff 2 }{ stuff 3} rather than standard [{}{}{}]

  Module 8: Fine-Tuning Inputs
    props.conf is very important
      inputs phase:
        character encoding (default is utf8)
        fine tuned source types
          can override the defaults on a per file basis

      parsing:
        event breaks
        time extraction
        event transformation

  Module 9: Parsing Phase and Data Preview
    props.conf.spec - LINE_BREAKER is best way to split lines, ProServ recommended
    Take extra time to ensure timestamps are correct
    Either TZ in timestamp, or specified in props.conf or tz of indexer
