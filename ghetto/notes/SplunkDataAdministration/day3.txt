Module 10:
  Modifying raw data before it's indexed
  use per event source types only in a last chance scenario, everything else is better
  to set metadata in transforms.conf
    SOURCE_KEY = _raw
    REGEX = server:(\w+)
    DEST_KEY = MetaData:Host
    FORMAT = host::$1
  Host => host::,

  To change the index at index-time (note the additional underscore here)
    REGEX = (Error|Warning)
    DEST_KEY = _MetaData:Index
    FORMAT = itops

  Filter Events
    FORMAT = nullQueue

  http://<splunk>/debug/refresh - forces splunk to refresh it's config(?)
    at a minimum it does the inputs configurations, definitely doesn't do the indexer


  I need to go over modules 10 and 11. Missed too much i fear

Module 12: Diag
  Creates diagnostic package for shipment to experts.
  ./splunk diag
  Create and index a diag
