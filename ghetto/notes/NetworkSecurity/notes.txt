  discussion about how this meeting works at the networking layer:
    Starts with discussion with the 7 layer OSI model (https://mplsnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/osi-model.gif)
      Every layer of the OSI model adds its own header, Data layer also adds a footer.
      Physical layer doesn't add any overhead because it's the bottom layer
      Top 3 layers (application, presentation, session) are the data. In the TCP/IP model this is the application layer
      Layer 4 (transport) are the segments, TCP/IP is also transport
      Layer 3 (network) is the packets, TCP/IP is the Internet layer
      Layer 2 (data link) is the frames and part of the TCP/IP Network Access layer
      Layer 1 (physical) comprises the bits and is the other part of the TCP/IP Network Access layer
  Homework:
    Chapter 1 & 2 of CompTIA network+
